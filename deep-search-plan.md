# Deep Search Implementation Plan

## Overview
Enhance the current search solution by implementing a multi-query approach with a reasoning agent that iteratively analyzes results and generates new search queries until sufficient information is gathered.

## Architecture

### 1. Initial Query Processing
- Take the user's original query
- Generate multiple relevant search queries using semantic expansion
- Prioritize queries based on relevance to the original question

### 2. Multi-Query Execution
- Execute searches using all generated queries
- Collect and deduplicate results
- Organize findings by relevance to the original query

### 3. Reasoning Agent
- Analyze search results to extract key information
- Identify knowledge gaps that require additional searches
- Generate new, focused queries to fill these gaps
- Decide when sufficient information has been gathered

### 4. Iterative Search Loop
- Execute the new queries generated by the reasoning agent
- Add new findings to the existing knowledge base
- Allow the reasoning agent to analyze the updated information
- Continue this process until the agent determines the answer is complete

### 5. Answer Formulation
- Organize gathered information into a coherent answer
- Structure the response with three key sections:
  - **Key Points**: Concise bullet points of the most important findings
  - **Direct Answer to Query**: Clear, direct response to the original question
  - **Detailed Notes**: Comprehensive analysis with supporting evidence and references

## Implementation Steps

1. Create a query expansion module to generate multiple relevant search queries
2. Implement a result collection and deduplication system
3. Develop the reasoning agent with capabilities to:
   - Analyze search results
   - Identify information gaps
   - Generate new queries
   - Determine search completion
4. Build the iterative search mechanism
5. Design the answer formatter according to the three-section structure
6. Integrate all components into a cohesive workflow

## Technical Considerations

- Ensure proper prompt engineering for query expansion
- Implement effective context management to maintain coherence across iterations
- Balance breadth and depth of searches to avoid excessive token usage
- Consider caching mechanisms for frequent searches
- Track search paths to avoid circular reasoning

## Success Metrics

- Completeness of answers compared to single-query approach
- Reduction in follow-up questions needed
- Improved accuracy of responses
- Reasonable performance in terms of time and tokens used
